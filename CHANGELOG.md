## 1.0.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Beginning with 1.0.0 release, Particle.publish() and Particle.subscribe() methods will require event scope to be specified explicitly. This means using `PRIVATE` or `PUBLIC` for `Particle.publish()` and `MY_DEVICES` or `ALL_DEVICES` for `Particle.subscribe()`.  Please update your apps to include the event scope to avoid compilation errors in firmware `>0.7.0`. Deprecation warnings for this change began with `0.7.0-rc.3` [#1365](https://github.com/spark/firmware/pull/1365)
- [Core/Photon/P1] `WiFi.RSSI()` must be cast to `int8_t` when used inline with Serial.print() to produce correct results.  E.g. `Serial.printlnf("%d", (int8_t) WiFi.RSSI() );` Electron is not affected. [#1423](https://github.com/particle-iot/firmware/pull/1423)

- [Photon/P1] A number of networking-related fixes [#1492](https://github.com/particle-iot/firmware/pull/1492)

- [Electron/Photon/P1] Fixes SOS in 0.8.0-rc.11 and also ensures button and OOM events are handled synchronously. Previously in multi-threaded applications the button handling may have been delayed to run within the application thread.

Previously in multi-threaded applications the button handling may have been delayed to run within the application thread.  Now it is always handled immediately and should be noted that it is called from an ISR, so it is not advised to dynamically allocate memory in button event handlers.
