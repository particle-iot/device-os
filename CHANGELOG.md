## v0.6.0-rc.1

### BREAKING CHANGES
- `UDP.flush()` and `TCP.flush()`  now conform to the `Stream.flush()` behavior from Arduino 1.0 Wiring. The current (correct) behavior is to wait
  until all data has been transmitted. Previous behavior discarded data in the buffer. [#469](https://github.com/spark/firmware/issues/469)

### FEATURES
