 * @note
 * Parameter @a xfer should point to a valid I2C_XFER_T structure object
 * and must have @a slaveAddr initialized with 7bit Slave address (From Bit1 to Bit7),
 * Bit0 when set enables general call handling, @a slaveAddr along with @a addrMask will
 * be used to match the slave address. @a rxBuff and @a txBuff must point to valid buffers
 * where slave can receive or send the data from, size of which will be provided by
 * @a rxSz and @a txSz respectively. Function pointed to by @a event will be called
 * for the following events #I2C_EVENT_SLAVE_RX (One byte of data received successfully
 * from the master and stored inside memory pointed by xfer->rxBuff, incremented
 * the pointer and decremented the @a xfer->rxSz), #I2C_EVENT_SLAVE_TX (One byte of
 * data from xfer->txBuff was sent to master successfully, incremented the pointer
 * and decremented xfer->txSz), #I2C_EVENT_DONE (Master is done doing its transfers
 * with the slave).<br>
 * <br>Bit-0 of the parameter @a addrMask is reserved and should always be 0. Any bit (BIT1
 * to BIT7) set in @a addrMask will make the corresponding bit in *xfer->slaveAddr* as
 * don't care. Thit is, if *xfer->slaveAddr* is (0x10 << 1) and @a addrMask is (0x03 << 1) then
 * 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13 will all be considered as valid slave addresses for the registered
 * slave. Upon receving any event *xfer->slaveAddr* (BIT1 to BIT7) will hold the actual
 * address which was received from master.<br>
 * <br><b>General Call Handling</b><br>
 * Slave can receive data from master using general call address (0x00). General call
 * handling must be setup as given below
 * 		- Call Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup() with argument @a sid as I2C_SLAVE_GENERAL
 * 			- xfer->slaveAddr ignored, argument @a addrMask ignored
 * 			- function provided by @a event will registered to be called when slave received data using addr 0x00
 * 			- xfer->rxBuff and xfer->rxSz should be valid in argument @a xfer
 * 		- To handle General Call only (No other slaves are configured)
 * 			- Call Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup() with sid as I2C_SLAVE_X (X=0,1,2,3)
 * 			- setup @a xfer with slaveAddr member set to 0, @a event is ignored hence can be NULL
 * 			- provide @a addrMask (typically 0, if not you better be knowing what you are doing)
 * 		- To handler General Call when other slave is active
 * 			- Call Chip_I2C_SlaveSetup() with sid as I2C_SLAVE_X (X=0,1,2,3)
 * 			- setup @a xfer with slaveAddr member set to 7-Bit Slave address [from Bit1 to 7]
 * 			- Set Bit0 of @a xfer->slaveAddr as 1
 * 			- Provide appropriate @a addrMask
 * 			- Argument @a event must point to function, that handles events from actual slaveAddress and not the GC
 * @warning
 * If the slave has only one byte in its txBuff, once that byte is transfered to master the event handler
 * will be called for event #I2C_EVENT_DONE. If the master attempts to read more bytes in the same transfer
 * then the slave hardware will send 0xFF to master till the end of transfer, event handler will not be
 * called to notify this. For more info see section below<br>
 * <br><b> Last data handling in slave </b><br>
 * If the user wants to implement a slave which will read a byte from a specific location over and over
 * again whenever master reads the slave. If the user initializes the xfer->txBuff as the location to read
 * the byte from and xfer->txSz as 1, then say, if master reads one byte; slave will send the byte read from
 * xfer->txBuff and will call the event handler with #I2C_EVENT_DONE. If the master attempts to read another
 * byte instead of sending the byte read from xfer->txBuff the slave hardware will send 0xFF and no event will
 * occur. To handle this issue, slave should set xfer->txSz to 2, in which case when master reads the byte
 * event handler will be called with #I2C_EVENT_SLAVE_TX, in which the slave implementation can reset the buffer
 * and size back to original location (i.e, xfer->txBuff--, xfer->txSz++), if the master reads another byte
 * in the same transfer, byte read from xfer->txBuff will be sent and #I2C_EVENT_SLAVE_TX will be called again, and
 * the process repeats.
