/* IOCTL Commands ***********************************************************/
/* The timer driver uses a standard character driver framework.  However,
 * since the timer driver is a device control interface and not a data
 * transfer interface, the majority of the functionality is implemented in
 * driver ioctl calls.  The timer ioctl commands are listed below:
 *
 * These are detected and handled by the "upper half" timer driver.
 *
 * TCIOC_START      - Start the timer
 *                    Argument: Ignored
 * TCIOC_STOP       - Stop the timer
 *                    Argument: Ignored
 * TCIOC_GETSTATUS  - Get the status of the timer.
 *                    Argument:  A writeable pointer to struct timer_status_s.
 * TCIOC_SETTIMEOUT - Reset the timer timeout to this value
 *                    Argument: A 32-bit timeout value in microseconds.
 * TCIOC_SETHANDLER - Call this handler on timer expiration
 *                    Argument: A pointer to struct timer_sethandler_s.
 *
 * WARNING: May change TCIOC_SETTIMEOUT to pass pointer to 64bit nanoseconds
 * or timespec structure.
 *
 * NOTE: The TCIOC_SETHANDLER ioctl cannot be supported in the kernel build
 * mode. In that case direct callbacks from kernel space into user space is
 * forbidden.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: timer_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function binds an instance of a "lower half" timer driver with the
 *   "upper half" timer device and registers that device so that can be used
 *   by application code.
 *
 *   When this function is called, the "lower half" driver should be in the
 *   disabled state (as if the stop() method had already been called).
 *
 *   NOTE:  Normally, this function would not be called by application code.
 *   Rather it is called indirectly through the architecture-specific
 *   initialization.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   dev path - The full path to the driver to be registers in the NuttX
 *     pseudo-filesystem.  The recommended convention is to name all timer
 *     drivers as "/dev/timer0", "/dev/timer1", etc.  where the driver
 *     path differs only in the "minor" number at the end of the device name.
 *   lower - A pointer to an instance of lower half timer driver.  This
 *     instance is bound to the timer driver and must persists as long as
 *     the driver persists.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, a non-NULL handle is returned to the caller.  In the event
 *   of any failure, a NULL value is returned.
