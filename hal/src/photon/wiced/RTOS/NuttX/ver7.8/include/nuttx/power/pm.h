/* Definition of terms.  Various "sleep" and low power consumption states
 * have various names and are sometimes used in conflicting ways.  In the
 * PM logic, we will use the following terminology:
 *
 * NORMAL  - The normal, full power operating mode.
 * IDLE    - This is still basically normal operational mode, the system is,
 *           however, IDLE and some simple simple steps to reduce power
 *           consumption provided that they do not interfere with normal
 *           Operation.  Simply dimming the a backlight might be an example
 *           somethat that would be done when the system is idle.
 * STANDBY - Standby is a lower power consumption mode that may involve more
 *           extensive power management steps such has disabling clocking or
 *           setting the processor into reduced power consumption modes. In
 *           this state, the system should still be able to resume normal
 *           activity almost immediately.
 * SLEEP   - The lowest power consumption mode.  The most drastic power
 *           reduction measures possible should be taken in this state. It
 *           may require some time to get back to normal operation from
 *           SLEEP (some MCUs may even require going through reset).
 *
 * State changes always proceed from higher to lower power usage:
 *
 * NORMAL->IDLE->STANDBY->SLEEP
 *   ^       |      |        |
 *   |       V      V        V
