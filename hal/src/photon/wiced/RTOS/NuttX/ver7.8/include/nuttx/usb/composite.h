 * Description:

 * Input Parameter:

 * Returned Value:
 *   A non-NULL "handle" is returned on success.  This handle may be used
 *   later with composite_uninitialize() in order to removed the composite
 *   device.  This handle is the (untyped) internal representation of the
 *   the class driver instance.
