 * Name: pm_update
 *
 * Description:
 *   This internal function is called at the end of a time slice in order to
 *   update driver activity metrics and recommended states.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   accum - The value of the activity accumulator at the end of the time
 *     slice.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function may be called from a driver, perhaps even at the interrupt
 *   level.  It may also be called from the IDLE loop at the lowest possible
 *   priority level.  To reconcile these various conditions, all work is
 *   performed on the worker thread at a user-selectable priority.
