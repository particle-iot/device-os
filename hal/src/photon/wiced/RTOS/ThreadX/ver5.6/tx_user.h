   though the compiler's equivalent of the -D option.  
   
   For maximum speed, the following should be defined:

        TX_MAX_PRIORITIES                       32  
        TX_DISABLE_PREEMPTION_THRESHOLD

   results in faster and smaller code, however, it increases the amount of processing in the ISR.

   therefore return an error if this option is used. This may or may not be desirable for a
