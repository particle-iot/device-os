/********************************* Bug Notice *********************************
On occasion, "wlan_ioctl_get_scan_results" only returns a single bad entry
(with index 0). I suspect this happens when the CC3000 is refreshing the
scan table; I think it deletes the current entries, does a new scan then
repopulates the table. If the function is called during this process
the table only contains the invalid zero indexed entry.
The good news is the way I've designed the function mitigates this problem.
The main while loop prevents the function from running for more than one
second; the inner while loop prevents the function from reading more than
16 entries from the scan table (which is the maximum amount it can hold).
The first byte of the scan table lists the number of entries remaining;
we use this to break out of the inner loop when we reach the last entry.
This is done so that we read out the entire scan table (ever after finding
our SSID) so the data isn't stale on the next function call. If the function
is called when the table contains invalid data, the index will be zero;
this causes the inner loop to break and start again; this action will
repeat until the scan table has been repopulated with valid entries (or the
one second timeout is reached). If the aforementioned "bug" is ever fixed by
TI, no changes need to be made to this function, as it would be implemented
the same way.
